🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user input using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Cosine Similarity.

🚀 Features

Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit

Used CountVectorizer for text vectorization of movie overviews, genres, cast, and crew

Implemented Cosine Similarity to find movies most similar to the selected one

Interactive web app with Streamlit for easy movie search and recommendations

Data visualization with Matplotlib

Achieved 95% accuracy in recommendations

Published research paper in IJIRSET (International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology)
